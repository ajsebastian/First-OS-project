# csi-280-2016sp-project01
This is a sample GitHub repository for CSI-280-5x Assignment 1. There are two sets of code examples, one in Java and one in Javascript. In both cases there is a test that needs to be fixed to allow it to pass the test phase of the build.

## Java
Running this module requires the following to be installed:
- Java JDK (OpenJDK is recommended)
- Maven

Once these are installed you can run the build with `mvn test`. This will execute both the compile and test portions of the build, including retrieving required dependencies.

## Javascript
Running this module requires the following to be installed:
- nodejs
- npm
- mocha (nodejs unit test framework)

Once these are installed you can download the remaining dependencies with `npm install`

The tests can be run with either `mocha` or `npm test`
